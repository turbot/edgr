This project consists of:

- `edgr` - a cli tool that can populate a postgres db with SEC filings for use in data analysis projects
- `github.com/edgr/core` a go module that requests SEC filers/filings and can be used in other go projects

## edgr CLI

The `edgr` tool makes jumpstarting your data analysis projects that much easier by abstacting away a lot of annoying SEC EDGAR data gathering and parsing. `edgr` can download, parse full text, and persist large quantities of SEC filings in a pre-configured postgres db.

### Installation

`edgr` supports macOS, linux, and windows systems.

#### Brew

The preferred way to install, run the following commands in the terminal after installing homebrew

```sh
brew tap turbot/edgr
brew install edgr
```

#### Download the binary

Distributions for your specific OS can be found on the releases page for this repo.

#### Build from source

Clone this repository and run `make build`

### Usage

`edgr` is a standard cli executable. A running/reachable postgres instance is required for proper usage. You can easily run one locally through docker.

```sh
docker run -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.6
```

The default parameters for `edgr` commands will be able to access this instance immediately.
Next, we need to set up the proper db tables to store data. In the terminal, run

```sh
edgr init
```

Finally, we need to insert some desired filers into the db so we can pull some filings.

```sh
# add the filer.
edgr filers init --symbol AAPL
# download 8-K filings for apple inc.
edgr get --symbol AAPL --form 8-K
```

Now you can access the raw text and meta-data associated with those filings in the database as you normally would, through other analytical tools or a command-line pg client. Run `edgr help` for more information regarding commands.

## `github.com/edgr/core` module

### Installation

Supports Go v1.13+ and modules. Run the usual

```sh
go get -u github.com/turbot/edgr
```

### Usage

There are 3 easy functions

```go
// GetPublicCompanies returns a list of public companies.
func GetPublicCompanies() ([]Company, error) {...}

// GetFiler gets a single filer from the SEC website based on symbol.
func GetFiler(symbol string) (filer *model.Filer, err error) {...}

// GetFilings gets a list of filings for a single CIK.
func GetFilings(cik, formtype, stoptime string) (filings []SECFiling, err error) {...}
```
